### Introduction

Welcome to my Cyclistic bike-share analysis project! In this project, I am analyzing data for Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago. Cyclistic offers a diverse range of bicycles, including traditional bikes, reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, through a network of over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Most users ride for leisure, although a significant portion about 30% use the bikes for their daily commute. Cyclistic's marketing strategy has focused on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. They offer flexible pricing plans including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders buy single-ride or full-day passes, while annual memberships are for Cyclistic members.  
The goal of the company is to maximize the number of annual memberships, which is crucial for its future growth. To achieve this, I need to understand the behavior of casual riders and annual members. By analyzing historical bike trip data, I aim to uncover insights into how these two groups use Cyclistic bikes differently.

### Business Problem

I need to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. By analyzing the differences in usage patterns, trip durations, and popular routes, I aim to identify key differences between these two groups. These insights will help the company design targeted marketing strategies to encourage casual riders to become annual members, ultimately supporting Cyclistic's growth objectives.
